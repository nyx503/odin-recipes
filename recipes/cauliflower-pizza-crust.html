        <h2>Your favorite Italian Dish</h2>
        <p>If you crave that special comfort food your Nonna used to make you but want it to be a little more healthy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 head cauliflower, cored and separated into florets</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 ounces fresh goat cheese</li>
            <li>½ ounce finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Puree cauliflower in a food processor until finely ground.</li>
            <li>Cook ground cauliflower, water, and salt together in a skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant and most of the water evaporates, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool completely.</li>
            <li>Transfer cauliflower to the center of a clean dish towel. Wrap and squeeze tightly to remove all excess moisture. You should have about 1 1/2 cups cauliflower pulp.</li>
            <li>Stir cauliflower, goat cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, egg, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl to form a soft dough. Gather dough into a ball and place in the center of the prepared baking sheet. Press dough into circle about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, about 40 minutes. Cool and turn crust over before topping.</li>
        </ol>
