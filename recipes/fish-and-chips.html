        <h2>For when you get homesick</h2>
        <p>Just make yourself some fish and chips, turn on the fan and pretend your at the shore. Works every time.</p>

            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Rinse fish, pat dry, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, garlic powder, paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper. Stir egg into dry ingredients. Gradually mix in beer until a thin batter is formed. You should be able to see the fish through the batter after it has been dipped.</li>
